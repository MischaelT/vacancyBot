# pr_vacancyBot

Telegram bot that aggregates vacancies from different sources.
In that project I used PostreSQL as database, Redis as state storage and brocker, Celery as task queue, and aiogram for developing bot itself.

All parser system located in folder /parser

For start a project, firstly install all dependencies:
<br>
<p>pip install -r requirements.txt</p>
<br>
Then you can just execute file main.py
